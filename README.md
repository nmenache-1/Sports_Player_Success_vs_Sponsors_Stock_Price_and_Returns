# Sports-Player-Success-vs.-Sponsors-stock-price-and-returns
Aim to find a link between the success of two players, Michael Jordan and Klay Thompson, with their sponsors', Nike and Anta, stock price and stock returns. Later in the file attempt to predict whether the following days returns would be positive or negative based on the current day's Jordan stats, using both a KNN classification and logistic regression, both yielding approximately 60% accuracy after optimization.

Once the zip has downloaded, run all cells again since the train-test split might yield slightly different results each time.
